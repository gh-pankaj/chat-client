## Chat-Client

This chat-client is created to demonstrate the implementation of my MSc project 'Sentiment and Emotion control in dialogue systems' which is submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science, Artificial Intelligence at Queen Mary University of London, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science in January 2020 by Pankaj Saini (p.saini@se18.qmul.ac.uk)
